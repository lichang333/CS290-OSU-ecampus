Exercise: Fixing Closure Loop
Do the activity in the Scope and Context (http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2015/cs290-400/content/core-content/js-functions-objects/js-scope-context.html) section. You need to fix bug with a loop and closures. Note you need to add a line that actually calls testList(); because there is no button like on the site to execute the code.

This is a pass/fail assignment based on submitting some code that looks like you gave it a good shot.
